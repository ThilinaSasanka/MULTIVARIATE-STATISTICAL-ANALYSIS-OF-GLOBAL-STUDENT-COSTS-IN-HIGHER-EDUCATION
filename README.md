### Multivariate-Statistical-Analysis-of-Global-Student-Costs-in-Higher-Education

*Course Project â€“ STA4053: Multivariate Methods II*

***Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook* 

- Cleaned, transformed, and analyzed a dataset of 907 international students to identify key financial patterns in higher education costs.
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, capturing nearly 90% of variance with four principal components focused on general cost burden, program duration, academic duration vs. visa, and exchange rate effects.
- Used Factor Analysis to uncover two main latent cost structures
- Employed Discriminant Analysis to classify programs into low, medium, and high cost categories, achieving 85.7% accuracy
- Conducted Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to explore relationships between program characteristics  and cost variables
- Demonstrated advanced preprocessing techniques, including outlier removal (IQR method), skew correction (log transformation), feature engineering (total cost, cost categories), feature encoding, and data standardization.
- Produced a comprehensive report with visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scree plots), model evaluations, and actionable recommendations for students and institutions.
- Provided insights to help stakeholders understand and compare the main drivers of international student expenses and plan more effectively for study abroad decisions
